# Paleoenvironmental Data
Due too not being able to install libgdal-dev on the cluster used for this project, the paleoenvironmental data was downloaded and processed on a local machine. The processed data was then uploaded to the github repository. The code written as a part of this pipeline should work on a machine with libgdal-dev installed, and will produce the same results as the data uploaded to the repository.
